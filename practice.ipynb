      "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find a local minimum of a differentiable function \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\); starting from an initial guess \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\), it updates the parameters by moving them in the direction of the steepest decrease, namely the negative gradient, according to the rule \\(\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{x}_k - \\alpha_k \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_k)\\), where \\(\\alpha_k>0\\) is a step‑size (or learning rate) that may be constant or adaptively chosen; each iteration reduces the function value (provided \\(\\alpha_k\\) is suitably small), and under appropriate conditions—convexity of \\(f\\) and a diminishing step‑size satisfying \\(\\sum_k \\alpha_k = \\infty\\) and \\(\\sum_k \\alpha_k^2 < \\infty\\)—the sequence \\(\\{\\mathbf{x}_k\\}\\) converges to a global minimizer, while for non‑convex functions it converges to a critical point (which may be a local minimum, saddle point, or maximum).\n",
